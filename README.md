# Simple-Rock-Paper-And-Scissors-Program

This is a basic Python script for the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, where you can play against the computer. Here’s a quick breakdown:

How it Works:

Computer’s Choice: The computer randomly picks one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors.
User’s Choice: You enter your choice via an input prompt.
Game Logic: The script compares your choice with the computer’s and decides who wins the round:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beat Paper
Paper beats Rock
Round Outcome: It displays whether you win, the computer wins, or if it’s a draw.

Example Run
Enter your choice rock, paper, scissors:: rock
Computer has chosen:: paper
Computer gets one point!!!


This game is a simple introduction to Python functions, if statements, and user input handling.
